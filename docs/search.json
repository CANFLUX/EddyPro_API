    "text": "About EddyPro®\n“EddyPro® Software” (2021) is one of the most popular applications for processing Eddy Covariance (EC) data.\n\nIt designed to provide easy, accurate EC flux computations LI-COR (2021).\nOpen source software with a graphic user interface (GUI)\n\nInterfaces with a processing pipeline is executed in FORTRAN\nBased on the “ECO2S” (2011) package"
