## About EddyPro&reg;


@noauthor_eddypro_2021 is one of the most popular applications for processing Eddy Covariance (EC) data.

* It designed to provide easy, accurate EC flux computations @li-cor_inc_eddypro_2021.
* Open source software with a graphic user interface (GUI)
    * Interfaces with a processing pipeline is executed in FORTRAN
    * Based on the @noauthor_eco2s_2011 package

## Who Uses EddyPro?

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
pth = 'survey/FLUXNET-CH4-Form-Responses.csv'
df=pd.read_csv(pth)
df = df.fillna('Not Specified')
g = 'What software do you use to process your high frequency (e.g., 10-20 Hz) flux data (examples could include: EddyPro, Eddy4R, in-house software, etc.)'
df[g]=df[g].replace({"I actually have no experience working with high frequency flux data, but I'm ready to learn about it.":'New User, No Preference Yet',
                     "I am new to it":'New User, No Preference Yet',
                     'EddyPro, Rstudio':'EddyPro + In-house',
                     'EddyPro, in-house':'EddyPro + In-house',
                     'EddyPro; in-house software':'EddyPro + In-house',
                     'in-house Matlab':'In-house',
                     'in-house software':'In-house',
                     'R':'In-house',
                     'Python':'In-house',
                     'Matlab':'In-house',
                     'aucun':'Not Specified'
                     })
summary = df.groupby(g).count()


plt.barh(summary['Timestamp'].sort_values().index,
summary['Timestamp'].sort_values())
plt.title('What software do you use to process your high frequency flux data? (Survey responses)')
a=1
```

## Advantages of EddyPro&reg;


The GUI makes flux processing accessible.

* Point and click processing without need for coding
* Users can see the wide range of methods options available
    * Links to comprehensive documentation
* Works great for processing a single season of EC data

## Disadvantages of EddyPro&reg;

Point and click processing becomes a bottle.

* New runs must be initiated each time more data comes in
    + Ample room for error when conducted by inexperienced users (e.g., research assistants)
    + Leads to delays in processing
* Long records take a long time to process, users may avoid:
    + Testing alternate methods 
    + Flux recalculation


## How the API Can Help?

The Application Program Interface (API) can be used to automate and parallelize flux processing. 

* Call the API from command line, a python script, or run in a Jupyter Notebook
    * Schedule runs at regular intervals as new data come in
    * Setup multiple runs to compare processing methods
* API will process longer in parallel to expedite processing
    * Can reduce processing time by a quarter or more


## How the API Can Help?

The Application Program Interface (API) can be help standardize flux processing. 


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

* Template .eddypro files serve as the basis for a project
    * View/modify options using the GUI or a text editor
* Works with LICOR (GHG) or Cambpbell (TOA5) files

## How does it work?

There are two main routines in the API which will be run in sequence when calling the script.

```{bash}
cd Path\To\eddyProAPI
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
python .\eddyProAPI.py --siteID ID --fileType ghg --dateRange 2024-06-01 2024-08-31
```

## Pre-processing

* Inspect for changes in metadata
    * Identify groups of common configuration
* Parses the high frequency data to generate descriptive statistics
    * Optional pre-filtering to exclude bad data
* Generate biomet and dynamic metadata files on-the-fly
    * Reads Biomet.Net database files
    
## Processing

* Runs EddyPro&reg; over the desired time period
    * Use a template .eddypro file to ensure standardized processing
    * Appended run-specific information (inputs, directories, etc.)
* Executes raw Data processing in parallel
* Flux processing and correction applied on a per-group basis
* Dump outputs to Biomet.Net database files

## What's next?

This project is still under development.

* Comprehensive documentation page will be available in the coming weeks
    * Basic usage instructions can be found on the [repo page](https://github.com/CANFLUX/EddyPro_API)

* I am looking for interested users to help with Beta testing!
    * Please reach out if you would like to try it out: june.skeeter@nrcan-rncan.gc.ca
