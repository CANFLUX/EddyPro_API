## About EddyPro&reg;


@noauthor_eddypro_2021 is one of the most popular applications for processing Eddy Covariance (EC) data.

* It designed to provide easy, accurate EC flux computations @li-cor_inc_eddypro_2021.
* Open source software with a graphic user interface (GUI)
    * Interfaces with a processing pipeline is executed in FORTRAN
    * Based on the @noauthor_eco2s_2011 package


## Advantages of EddyPro&reg;


The GUI makes flux processing accessible.

* Point and click processing without need for coding
* Users can see the wide range of methods options available
    * Links to comprehensive documentation
* Works great for processing a single season of EC data

## Disadvantages of EddyPro&reg;

Point and click processing becomes a bottle.

* New runs must be initiated each time more data comes in
    + Ample room for error when conducted by inexperienced users (e.g., research assistants)
    + Leads to delays in processing
* Long records take a long time to process, users may avoid:
    + Testing alternate methods 
    + Flux recalculation


## How the API Can Help?

The Application Program Interface (API) can be used to automate and parallelize flux processing. 

* Call the API from command line, a python script, or run in a Jupyter Notebook
    * Schedule runs at regular intervals as new data come in
    * Setup multiple runs to compare processing methods
* API will process longer in parallel to expedite processing
    * Can reduce processing time by a quarter or more


## How the API Can Help?

The Application Program Interface (API) can be help standardize flux processing. 

* Template EddyPro&reg; files serve as the basis for a project
    * Users can view/modify options using the EddyPro&reg; GUI or a text editor
    * Viewing .eddypro files in a text editor allows for quick differentiation
